# TwitterSearches
An app that allows users to search, share, and save their favorite Twitter tags.
This is the TwitterSearches App from the Android 6 for Programmers book 3rd Edition by Deitel Developer Series.

This app allows you to save your favorite search queries with easy to remember short tag names that are displayed as a scrollable list.
You can then scroll through your saved searches and simply touch a tag name to quicky view tweets on a given topic. You may also share,
edit, and delete saved searches.

This application teaches how to use SharedPreferences, the SharedPreferences.Editor, Implicit Intents, Intent Choosers,
RecyclerView, RecyclerView.Adapter, RecyclerView.ViewHolder, and Recyclerview.ItemDecoration.

I, myself, specifically commented on every line of code so that a beginner Android developer may clearly understand and learn from
this application.
